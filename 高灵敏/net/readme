"model2pose-butongweizhi" in 0114_data_cpt.. and xiaoguo256 they have the 85pixels and from 1024*1 data to 32*32 input and 256*256(32*8) output ,in models_resnetx line 140 return 0.3 * self.relu(x)

0113_data_cpt... in model256 and xiaoguo256 they have the 85pixels and from 1024*1 data to 32*32 input and 256*256(32*8) output ,but it is trained in the same day as 0219_data_cpt... and 0218_data_cpt...,so they can be compare ,but 0112_data_cpt..is trained early than the others,so may not suitable as 0113_data_cpt...in models_resnetx line 140 return 0.7 * self.relu(x)

0114_data_cpt... is same as model2pose-butongweizh.,it try to reproduce the 0112_data,because 0112_data is far away from now,so
in models_resnetx line 140 return 0.3 * self.relu(x)

/model2pose-butongweizhi/0306_data_cpt_... 2000data wide the net add psp to test wide net
because the code wrong,so next train again
